            &emsp; This was a project I worked on in UC Berkeley’s “Snap!”. My goal was to parlay the basic “Snap!” library into something more comprehendible, I accomplished that goal by making this video game. The game is simple, you control a basket that can either move left or right attempting to catch as many falling apples as possible. In making the simple game, I practiced  efficient coding methods, comprehended the “Snap!” library, and created a better understanding of coding for myself.  And while it is quite simple, its basic structure highlights the simplicity yet endless possibilities of coding.

            &emsp; In my AP Computer Science Principles Class, I have an hour every Friday to work on a personal project, a reflection of Google’s 20% time. Within this hour, known as Genius Hour, I decided to work on a Python data science project. This image is a portion of the project I’m working on that revolves around tracking Covid-19 Cases in my local school district, accomplishing that goal using Python data science. This project helped me learn more about more practical uses of Python, namely Python in data science.
