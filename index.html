          <p>
            &emsp; This was a project I worked on in UC Berkeley’s “Snap!”. My goal was to parlay the basic “Snap!” library into something more comprehendible, I accomplished that goal by making this video game. The game is simple, you control a basket that can either move left or right attempting to catch as many falling apples as possible. In making the simple game, I practiced  efficient coding methods, comprehended the “Snap!” library, and created a better understanding of coding for myself.  And while it is quite simple, its basic structure highlights the simplicity yet endless possibilities of coding.

          <h2>AP CS Genius Hour</h2>
          <p><a href="#">Link To Project</a></p>
          <p>
            &emsp; In my AP Computer Science Principles Class, I have an hour every Friday to work on a personal project, a reflection of Google’s 20% time. Within this hour, known as Genius Hour, I decided to work on a Python data science project. This image is a portion of the project I’m working on that revolves around tracking Covid-19 Cases in my local school district, accomplishing that goal using Python data science. This project helped me learn more about more practical uses of Python, namely Python in data science.

          <h2>C++ Number System Converter</h2>
          <p><a href="#">Link To Project</a></p>
          <p>
            &emsp; I had a goal in mind over summer 2021, that was to learn new programming languages. This is my number system converter that I made myself in C++ for the purpose of learning C++ and making something useful. The program prompts the user to select either binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or octal, and for the user to input a number in their chosen number system. After the user inputs their number, they can convert it to any of the other number systems provided. This project was quite challenging and enjoyable to create, helping me develop a better understanding of C++ but also problem solving in general.

          <p>
            &emsp; In my AP Computer Science Principles class, I had to make an app using UC Berkeley’s “Snap!” The app focuses on educating a younger audience on electronics, making the graphics friendly to target that audience. I worked on this with a team of three, each of us using our minds collectively to accomplish the same goal.
